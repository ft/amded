* 0.5 → 0.6:

    - Rename "filename" to "file-name" in machine-readable output.

* 0.4 → 0.5 (released 2013-11-04):

    - Add support for deleting tags (like ‘album’) via ‘-d’.

    - Add support for stripping all tags from a file via ‘-S’.

      ‘-S’ also supports stripping a certain tag block out of files, that
      support multiple tag implementations to be present at the same time. For
      example, to strip a id3v1 tag block out of an mp3 file, the following
      command gets it done: taggit -W mp3=id3v1 -S foo-bar.mp3

* 0.3 → 0.4 (released 2013-11-02):

    - Remove "-E".

    - Introduce "-o", which allows the user to pass in one or more parameters

    - Introduce the ‘show-empty’ parameter (Thus, "-o show-empty" resembles the
      previous "-E" behaviour).

    - Changed tag-names:

      - tracktitle  → track-title
      - tracknumber → track-number
      - filetype    → file-type
      - tagtype     → tag-type
      - tagtypes    → tag-types
      - is_va       → is-va
      - bitrate     → bit-rate
      - samplerate  → sample-rate

    - Removed tag-names:

      - kbitrate
      - ksamplerate
      - mm:ss

    - New tag-names:

      - catalog-number
      - composer
      - conductor
      - label
      - performer

    - Internally, this release is a complete rewrite of the old C code-base in
      C++, which allows us to better leverage TagLib's API. Some care has been
      given to introduce as little incompatibilities as possible. There may be
      some anyway. If something behaves differently from what the manual
      describes, than that's a bug: Please report it!

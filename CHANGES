* 0.3 -> 0.4:

    - Remove "-E".

    - Introduce "-o", which allows the user to pass in one or more parameters

    - Introduce the ‘show-empty’ parameter (Thus, "-o show-empty" resembles the
      previous "-E" behaviour).

    - Changed tag-names:

      - tracktitle  → track-title
      - tracknumber → track-number
      - filetype    → file-type
      - tagtype     → tag-type
      - tagtypes    → tag-types
      - is_va       → is-va
      - bitrate     → bit-rate
      - samplerate  → sample-rate

    - Removed tag-names:

      - kbitrate
      - ksamplerate
      - mm:ss

    - New tag-names:

      - catalog-number
      - composer
      - conductor
      - label
      - performer

    - Internally, this release is a complete rewrite of the old C code-base in
      C++, which allows us to better leverage TagLib's API. Some care has been
      given to introduce as little incompatibilities as possible. There may be
      some anyway. If something behaves differently from what the manual
      describes, than that's a bug: Please report it!

taggit - Basic command line tagging engine for audio files


What it is:
    Taggit is based on KDE's taglib[1]. It is a very basic program,
    that lists and modifies meta information found in audio files.

What it is NOT:
    Taggit is *not* an automatic tagging utility. But it can be used
    as a tagging backend in higher-level applications.


Requirements:
    In order to build taggit, you will need:
        - its source
        - a C compiler
        - taglib installed on the system (including its headers)
        - txt2tags to generate taggit's manual


Building:
    For users:
    % make all doc

    For developers:
    % make depend tags
    % make all doc
    % make devdoc

    To enable debugging:
    % make all ADDTO_CFLAGS=-DTAGGIT_DEBUG

    For distributors:
    % make all doc "ADDTO_CFLAGS=-DVENDOR_VERSION=\"\\\"debian 0.2-3\\\"\""


Installation:
    % make install

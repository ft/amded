taggit - Basic command line tagging engine for audio files

What it is:
    Taggit is based on KDE's taglib[1]. It is a very basic program,
    that lists and modifies meta information found in audio files.

What it is NOT:
    Taggit is *not* an automatic tagging utility. But it can be used
    as a tagging backend in higher-level applications.


Requirements:
    In order to build taggit, you will need:
        - its source
        - a C compiler
        - taglib installed on the system (including its headers)
        - txt2tags to generate taggit's manual

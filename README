taggit - Basic command line tagging engine for audio files


What it is:
    Taggit is based on KDE's taglib[1]. It is a very basic program,
    that lists and modifies meta information found in audio files.

What it is NOT:
    Taggit is *not* an automatic tagging utility. But it can be used
    as a tagging backend in higher-level applications.


Requirements:
    In order to build taggit, you will need:
        - a C++11-able C++ compiler
        - taglib installed on the system (including its headers)
        - pkg-config to figure out where taglib lives on the system
        - txt2tags to generate taggit's manual
        - exuberant ctags if you're planning to use `make tags'


Current File Type Support:

    - Ogg Vorbis
    - Ogg FLAC
    - MP3 (id3v2, id3v1 and apetag support)


Building:

    For users:
    % make all doc

    The default compiler in Makefile is ‘clang++’. You can change the default
    by supplying a CXX parameter for ‘make’:

    % make all doc CXX=g++

    For developers:
    % make depend tags
    % make all doc
    % make devdoc


Installation:
    % make install
